 ## Design & Implementation    
 {Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}    
## 1.1 Architecture  
  
  
The architecture diagram shown above gives a overview of the various components used.  
  
## 1.2 Task Component  
  
The Task component depends on 3 other components,  
  
 1. Command Component - The Command component issues instructions for the Task component to execute based on the user's input. 
 
 2. UI Component - The UI component is used to display the results (and related exceptions) of the commands issued to the Task Component.
 
 3. ResourceLoader Component - The ResourceLoader component is used to load the list of tasks stored perviously when the application is started and is also used to store the current list of tasks to the local storage upon exit.

The task component contains 8 separate classes. They are as follows:  
 
  1. Task : Abstract class used to model a generic task.
   
  2. Event : Specialized task class used to model events. 
  
  3. Deadline : Specialized task class used to model a deadline.  
   
  4. TaskType : Enumeration class used to denote the various task types.  
  
  5. TaskList : Container class used to store list of tasks and handle related operations.
   
  6. SchedulableTask : Class used to model a task which is scheduled based on user's requirements. 
  
  7. TaskComparator : Contains a custom comparator used to compare two schedulable tasks based on their numberOfDaysLeft attribute. 
  
  8.  TaskScheduler : Class used to check for feasibility and schedule a list of tasks based on user's requirements.    
 
 ## 1.3 Study Area Component  
   
 The Study Area component depends on 3 other components,  
   
  1. Command Component - The Command component issues instructions for the Study Area component to execute based on the user's input. 
  
  2. UI Component - The UI component is used to display the results (and related exceptions) of the commands issued to the Study Area Component.
  
  3. ResourceLoader Component - The ResourceLoader component is used to load data of all existing Study Areas in NUS into text files when the User first run the software. Eventually, data will be referred from the created text file.

   4. TaskType : Enumeration class used to denote the various task types.  
   
   5. TaskList : Container class used to store list of tasks and handle related operations.
    
   6. SchedulableTask : Class used to model a task which is scheduled based on user's requirements. 
   
   7. TaskComparator : Contains a custom comparator used to compare two schedulable tasks based on their numberOfDaysLeft attribute.

 ## 2.1 Scheduling Tasks
 ### 2.1.1 Implementation
 Inorder to schedule tasks based on the user's requirement a sepaarate SchedulableTask class was created.
 The user's requirements (Name, Time to complete it, Deadline) are captured for each of the tasks to be scheduled.
 The requirements captured are stored in the SchedulableTask object.
 Then, the TaskScheduler finds the optimum schedule based on the user's requirements using the EDF (Early Deadline First) algorithm.
 Since, EDF is an optimum algorithm, if it can't find a valid schedule it means that it's impossible to find a valid schedule based on the user's requirement.
 If a feasible schedule is found it is displayed, else a message stating that a schedule based on the user's  requirements can't
 be made is displayed.
 
### 2.1.2 Alternatives
Aspect : How to capture user's requirements

 - Alternative 1 (Current Choice) : Create a seperate SchedulableTask object to store user's requirements for each task to be scheduled
	  - Pros : New class object can be customised without affecting core functionalities if the attributes provided by the user changes
	  - Cons : New methods similar to previously implemented methods have to be created instead of being reused.
  - Alternative 2 : Modify existing event or deadline class to model user's requirements
	  - Pros : Led to reuse of methods and reduce coupling between classes in the TaskComponent.
	  - Cons : Major changes would be required throughout various components to accomodate the new feature. 

Finally the first alternative was implemented as it was easier to implement and maintain it if changes were required to the user's requirements (e.g. Changes to the number of parameters provided by the user).
